 *         Submitted by Kylee Fluckiger & Chloe Josien
 * 
 *         Implements file compression and decompression using Huffman's algorithm.
 * 
 *         Instead of compressing on just characters, we treat words as symbols
 *         as well. To see what the best levels of compression are, we choose
 *         the "N" most frequent words (modified by their length) and use these
 *         along with characters as symbols for compression.
